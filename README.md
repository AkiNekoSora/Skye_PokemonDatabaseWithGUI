This is the Main Project for Software Development I. I decided to create a Pokémon Database. During this Module, I made the Logic and Input Validation for the main methods of the database. I also created some tests for a few of the classes for fun.

The folder also contains 
      
	  - A .jar file to run the system. 
      - 2 .txt files to test the "Add Pokemon using a .txt file" method.


Notes from the Main Class
-------------------------
The object of this project is to allow a user to enter information about a single Pokémon and will hold a list of Pokémon. It allows users to add Pokémon using the GUI or a .txt document, remove Pokémon, search for a specific Pokémon using a Pokédex Number, display a list of all Pokémon to the GUI, update a Pokémon using the GUI, compare the weight and height of two specified Pokémon, and check to see when a specified Pokémon will evolve.

The list of information the system holds for each Pokémon is:
    
	- Pokémon Name
	- Pokédex Number
	- Pokémon Types (1 or 2)
	- nextEvolutionLevel
	- Pokémon Weight
	- Pokémon Height
	- Has the Pokémon been caught
	- Pokédex Entry
